//* String.concat() - it concatenates text
//*String.substring() - like slice but it doesn't create new string IMPLICIT
//* String.slice() also works on strings
//* When we have a lastIndex that is a negative number it is equal to 0
//* String.replace/!replaceAll(search,replace) - It only works for the 1st one
//* String.includes()
//* String.repeat()
//* String.trim() - It removes all the white spaces
//* String.padEnd(5[the new desired length], "symbol/char")
//* String.charCodeAt()

//? forEach() - for loop on 1 line

let word1 = "hamburger";
let word2 = "burger";
let i = word1.indexOf(word2);
console.log(i);
